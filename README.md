Somewhat experimental map, basically an attempt at a compact version of a standard attrition map, featuring high verticality.

Required on both client and server side in order to work. Will crash unless impact marks are disabled in settings, and sometimes crashes on loading the map. If the map loading crash occurs, just keep trying again, it will load eventually.

To use, take the skrubslayer.mp_sanctuary folder in the mods folder and place it in your northstar mods folder (mod managers may do this automatically). To access the map, enter the private match menu and type this:
map mp_sanctuary
